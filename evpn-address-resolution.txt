                  EVPN IP Address Resolution Extension
            draft-ietf-brissette-evpn-address-resolution-00

Abstract

   This document presents an enhanced control plane for Ethernet VPN
   (EVPN) that eliminates the need for data plane flooding of ARP/ND
   messages.  EVPN enables hosts to communicate within the same subnet,
   and the current EVPN E-LAN solution relies on data plane flooding for
   IP address resolution.  This proposed solution aims to reduce
   flooding and optimize communication in large-scale networks.

1.  Introduction

   Ethernet VPN (EVPN) solutions, as defined in [RFC7432], facilitate
   communication between connected endpoints (CE) or hosts that share
   the same subnet.  This communication utilizes broadcast and multicast
   forwarding, also known as flooding, which is a common behavior in
   Layer-2 networks.  However, this flooding behavior can pose
   challenges for some providers, leading to unpredictable patterns and
   increased bandwidth consumption in their networks.  Moreover, it may
   expose security risks, potentially enabling malicious users to launch
   DDoS attacks.

   While [RFC9161] has made significant progress in reducing flooding
   over EVPN networks through ARP/ND proxy behavior, certain aspects
   remain unresolved.  The initial sign of life messaging when a CE/host
   connects to the network is not addressed.  Intra-subnet communication

Internet-Draft         EVPN IP Address Resolution            August 2023


   relies on neighbor discovery protocols (ARP/ND), where ARP requests
   and Neighbor Solicitation (NS) messages are flooded across the
   Layer-2 core network to all remote devices connected to that subnet.

   Unfortunately, in a large-scale network, this flood of three or more
   broadcast/multicast messages from CE/hosts to discover remote CE/
   hosts can lead to unpredictable flooding storms.  Some deployments
   resort to provisioning static ARP/ND entries to mitigate this
   behavior.  However, maintaining such a list of static entries proves
   to be costly and cumbersome, especially when adding or removing new
   CE/hosts.

1.1.  Terminology

   CE:  Customer Edge Router

   DAD:  IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection message

   GARP:  Gratuitous ARP message

   NA:  IPv6 Neighbor Advertisement message

   ND:  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery

   NS:  IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation message

   PE:  Provider Edge Router

   Request / Solicitation:  The term request is widely used in this
      document.  It refers to ARP request for IPv4 or ND solicitation
      for IPv6.

   RPL:  Route Policy Language

   RT-2:  Referring to EVPN route type-2 (MAC/IP)

2.  Address Resolution Solution

   This document proposes a new solution extending the EVPN control-
   plane where the IP address resolution is performed from control-plane
   rather than data-plane.  The procedure leverages ARP/ND proxy
   capabilities as described in [RFC9161].  The following section
   describes the behaviour to perform ARP resolution.  Neighbor
   Discovery Protocol works in a similar manner.

   Layer-2 Network

   This picture shows a simple layer-2 network where a common subnet is
   shared across CE1 and CE2.  PE1 and PE2 support the new IP address
   resolution procedure.

   In this example, CE1 initiates the communication with CE2 using ARP
   protocol.  The new procedure is as follow:

   1.  CE1 sends ARP requests to PE1 with destination IP=IP2 and
       broadcast MAC address as destination address.

   2.  PE1 punts incoming ARP requests to control-plane.  Data-plane
       floods these requests to all locally connected ACs (in the same
       broadcast domain) only and avoids the replication / flooding to
       any remote PEs over the L2 core.

   3.  PE1 learns the CE1 ARP request entry in control-plane to keep
       track of this request.  PE1 creates a single new BGP-EVPN IP
       address resolution route, which is advertised to remote PEs
       (PE2).  Basically, it requests all remote PEs to look for a
       specific IP address which may be connected for probing purpose.

   4.  PE2 receives a single IP address resolution route and triggers
       local CE2 ARP request to all locally connected ACs in the same
       broadcast domain.  PE2 uses CE1 source MAC/IP per ARP request
       towards connected CEs for transparency.  PE2 performs local
       probing for specific destination IP2 address.  This becomes a
       local behaviour from PE2 point-of-view.

   5.  CE2 receives the ARP request and sends an ARP reply with its own
       information.

   6.  The reply may be punted to control-plane on PE2 where the new
       MAC_CE2 and IP_CE2 binding is created.  The PE2 advertises to PE1
       via existing EVPN RT2 (MAC+IP) the CE2 host information.  CE2s
       ARP Reply may also be forwarded based on a lookup on the
       destination MAC address via the layer-2 data-plane.

Internet-Draft         EVPN IP Address Resolution            August 2023


   7.  PE1 may create local MAC/IP binding entry in control-plane based
       on received BGP EVPN RT-2.  Based on the ARP request entry
       learned initially, PE1 creates an ARP reply message and send it
       to CE1.  PE1 uses CE2_MAC + CE2_IP for this ARP reply.
       Optionally, a GARP may be transmitted in replacement of the ARP
       reply as recommended per [RFC9161] when ARP proxy is in use.

   8.  PE1 marks the initial CE2 request as resolved in control-plane.
       The associated IP address resolution route advertised in BGP is
       withdrawn.

3.  BGP EVPN Address Resolution Route

   The IP address resolution procedure requires a new BGP route in EVPN.
   The BGP EVPN NLRI as defined in [RFC7432] is shown below:


               +-----------------------------------+
               |    Route Type (1 octet)           |
               +-----------------------------------+
               |     Length (1 octet)              |
               +-----------------------------------+
               | Route Type specific (variable)    |
               +-----------------------------------+


   BGP EVPN NLRI

   This document defines an additional route type (TBD) in the IANA
   "EVPN Route Types" registry [EVPNRouteTypes] to be used for the
   advertisement of EVPN probing route:

   *  Value: TBD

   *  Description: IP Address Resolution

   For backward interoperability, a node that does not recognize the
   route type TBD (RT-TBD) will ignore it.

   The detailed encoding of this route and associated procedures are
   described in the following sections.

3.1.  Address Resolution Encoding

   An EVPN IP Address Resolution route type for IPv4 or IPv6 consists of
   the following fields:

               |      RD (8 octets)                     |
               +----------------------------------------+
               | Ethernet Segment Identifier (10 octets)|
               +----------------------------------------+
               | Ethernet Tag ID (4 octets)             |
               +----------------------------------------+
               | Source MAC address (6 octets)          |
               +----------------------------------------+
               | Destination MAC address (6 octets)     |
               +----------------------------------------+
               | Source IP Prefix Len                   |
               |    (1 octet, 0 to 32 or 128)           |
               +----------------------------------------+
               | Source IP Prefix (4 or 16 octets)      |
               +----------------------------------------+
               | Destination IP Prefix Len              |
               |    (1 octet, 0 to 32 or 128)           |
               +----------------------------------------+
               | Destination IP Prefix (4 or 16 octets) |

   EVPN Address Resolution Route NLRI for IPv4 and IPv6

   Where:

   *  The Length field of the BGP EVPN NLRI for an EVPN IP Address
      Resolution route MUST be either 44 (if IPv4 addresses are carried)
      or 68 (if IPv6 addresses are carried).  The source and destination
      IP prefixes MUST be from the same IP address family.

   *  The Route Distinguisher (RD) and Ethernet Tag ID MUST be used as
      defined in [RFC7432].  In particular, the RD is unique per MAC-
      VRF.

   *  The Ethernet Segment Identifier may be a non-zero 10-octet
      identifier.  It identifies the first-hop interface when an ESI is
      configured.  The ESI format is described in [RFC7432].

   *  The source MAC address is the one from the CE originating the IP
      address resolution request.

Internet-Draft         EVPN IP Address Resolution            August 2023


   *  The destination MAC address is the one received from the request
      on the first-hop PE.  It can either be set to broadcast MAC
      address or be set to a specific value when the PE is dealing with
      a unicast request.

   *  The source IP prefix length can be set to a value between 0 and 32
      (bits) for IPv4 and between 0 and 128 for IPv6, and it specifies
      the number of bits in the prefix.  The value MUST NOT be greater
      than 128.

   *  The source IP prefix is a 4- or 16-octet field (IPv4 or IPv6).
      The value is set to the source IP address of the originator of the
      request.

   *  The destination IP prefix length can be set to a value between 0
      and 32 (bits) for IPv4 and between 0 and 128 for IPv6, and it
      specifies the number of bits in the prefix.  The value MUST NOT be
      greater than 128.

   *  The destination IP prefix is a 4- or 16-octet field (IPv4 or
      IPv6).  The value is set to the targeted IP address of the
      incoming request.

   The RD, Ethernet Tag ID, source and destination MAC, source and
   destination IP prefix length and IP prefix are part of the route key
   used by BGP to compare routes.  The rest of the fields are not part
   of the route key.

4.  Considerations

   There are clear reasons for the usage of a new EVPN BGP route type to
   perform IP address resolution:

   *  Possible prioritization of routes exchange between PE (importance
      of ARP/ND request/solicitation compare to other routes).

   *  Specific manipulation over each IP address resolution request and
      response (security feature, RPL, etc.).

   *  Usage of dedicate route reflector for scalability and performance
      to handle specifically any address resolution routes.

   *  Backward interoperability with current machinery.  For instance,
      the extension of RT-2 to achieve similar behaviour is
      inappropriate.  Existing deployed routers may explicit use RT-2
      routes for forwarding purpose only.

Internet-Draft         EVPN IP Address Resolution            August 2023


   *  Provides behavioural transparency by carrying source host MAC and
      IP address to remote PEs.

4.1.  Usage of ESI field

   The ESI field is meaningful when CE/host is connected to multi-homed
   PE running all-active load-balancing mode.  Its purpose is to avoid
   unnecessary probing towards the originating CE/host from where the
   initial request was sourced.

4.2.  Originating Address

   MAC address and IP address of the originating CE are transmitted as
   part of the new NLRI.  They serve multiple purposes:

   *  Allow remote PE to reconstruct the ARP/ND request packet as if it
      was received from the data-plane.  The targeted CE won't notice
      the difference between control-plane based and data-plane based
      solutions.

   *  Allow multiple CE/host to send ARP/ND request towards the same
      destination.  Having the source MAC and IP has part of the NLRI
      key keep all routes unique.

   *  Allow PE to provide security check over the source.

4.3.  Rebuilding NS message on Egress PE

   In the case of IPv6, the neighbor solicitation (NS) message MUST be
   built as specified in [RFC4861] sections 4.3 and 7.2.2 for the
   address lookup NS message.

   The Source IP address and the Link Layer Address in the SLLOA option
   MUST be set to the Source IP Prefix and the Source MAC address in the
   EVPN Address Resolution Route NLRI Figure 1, respectively.

   The target address MUST be set to the Destination IP Prefix field of
   the NLRI, and the IP destination address is solicited-node multicast
   address (SNMA) corresponding to the target address a mandated by
   [RFC4861].

   The receiver is expected to use the SLLAO and not the source MAC to
   reply.  At Layer-2, the source MAC MUST be that of the sender (this
   node).  The receiver is expected to use the SLLAO and not the source
   MAC to build its neighbor cache entry (NCE).  If the receiver is not
   compliant and uses the the source MAC instead, this router will
   receive and route the packets from the receiver to the source IP.

Internet-Draft         EVPN IP Address Resolution            August 2023


   The destination SHOULD be set to the multicast MAC address associated
   to the SNMA (see section 7 of [RFC2464] for Ethernet, unless the
   source already knows a possible MAC address for the destination in
   which case, the unicast MAC MUST be tried first.

5.  Security Considerations

   The mechanisms in this document use EVPN control-plane as defined in
   [RFC7432].  Security considerations described in [RFC7432] are
   equally applicable.  This document uses MPLS and IP-based tunnel
   technologies to support data-plane transport.  Security
   considerations described in [RFC7432] and in [RFC8365] are equally
   applicable.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the allocation of value TBD in the "EVPN Route
   Types" registry defined by [RFC7432] and modification of the registry
   as follows:
